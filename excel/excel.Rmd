```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First we will create a data frame.

``` {r}
df <- data.frame(date = seq.Date(from = as.Date("2018-10-01"), to = as.Date("2018-10-08"), by = "1 day"),
                 item = rep(c("A", "B"), 4),
                 price = rep(c("100", "50"), 4))
```

Next we will write it to a .csv file.

``` {r}
write.csv(df, "nick-test.csv")
```

Finally, we will set the output_metadata so the file is attached to any scheduled emails and also saved in a persistent location.

``` {r}
rmarkdown::output_metadata$set(rsc_output_files = list("nick-test.csv"),
                               rsc_email_attachments = list("nick-test.csv"))
```

Now, our CSV file is written to a persistent location. You can find it [here](nick-test.csv).
